# The Winter Olympics

### Data Visualization Project

I decided on 3 relatively simple data points, each with two main variables. I initially tried to do more crazy stuff (with a map, or with 3 variables) but had a hard time getting the code to work. The points I chose were: Total medals won by Canada, Total Ice Hockey medals won by 3 of the top countries, and the number of people named John in the database who have won medals since 1924. 

## Tools Used

I used Sublime Text and Python 3 to create the modules and graphs, and just Sublime Text for the HTML & CSS. To run the files, I use GitBash for Windows 10. 

## Requirements

You will only need a browser to see my page. To make the modules work, you should have Python 3 (and csv, matplotlib) installed. 

## Installation

To run the programs: clone the project, cd to your directory / download, and run the .py files in a Terminal Window.
To view the webpage, simply open the index.html file in a browser.
